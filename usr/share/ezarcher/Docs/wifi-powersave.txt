NetworkManager WiFi Power Saving

If you find that the wifi adapter goes into power saving mode when the system goes 
to sleep and/or hibernation, the power saving feature of the wifi adapter can be 
changed by Network Manager configuration files. Here are two examples of files to 
either disable or enable the wifi-powersave feature.

The first file disables wifi-powersave and the second file enables it. 

wifi-powersave-off.conf
	# File to be place under /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d
	# Values are 0 (use default), 1 (ignore/don't touch), 2 (disable) or 3 (enable).
	[connection]
	wifi.powersave = 2

wifi-powersave-on.conf
	# File to be place under /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d
	# Values are 0 (use default), 1 (ignore/don't touch), 2 (disable) or 3 (enable).
	[connection]
	wifi.powersave = 3

Only one of these two files needs to be put in the folder: /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/

Once you have put the file in the right folder, simply restart NetworkManager:

	sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
